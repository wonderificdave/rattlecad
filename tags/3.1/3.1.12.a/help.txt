

What is the aim of this program?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

    The program should guide you through the different process steps 
    during definition of a bicycle frame represented in tabs:

    Personal:
            ... define riders parameter
                You can edit parameters by doubleclicking the measured value
                on the coloured dimensions. 
                
    Detail:
            ... define the main geometry parameters
                Editing like in Personal Tab
                
    Frame:
            ... detail your geometry to define all tube parameters
                Editing like in Personal Tab
                
    Assembly:
            ... take your frame and assemble it with components
                There are no dimensions to edit but you can exchange components
                if still defined for rattleCAD. The library should be filled
                with more components.

    Dimensions / Drafting - Frame / Drafting - Jig:
            ... summaries for the workshop
                There are of course no dimensions to edit

    

How to edit parameters
-----------------------------------------------------------------

    This is great change since rattleCAD 2.x.
    You can edit parameters by doubleclicking the measured value
    on the coloured dimensions. Inactive dimensions are mostly gray
    coloured.



How to zoom in / out
-----------------------------------------------------------------

    Take a look on the button bar near the "exit" Button
        scale minus
        scale plus
        resize
        
    You can also play with your mouse buttons.
    Press the right mouse button on the graphic area, drag the mouse 
    over the screen and release it. 
    You can get the standard scale with the resize button near the
    "exit" Button in the button bar. 
    


How to move the zoomed area
-----------------------------------------------------------------

    Press the left mouse button on the graphic area, drag the mouse 
    over the screen and release it. During dragging a red line appears
    and shows you the direction of dragging.
 

  
Why Reference and Personal Tabs
-----------------------------------------------------------------

    Personal Tab:
	    The position of handlebar is locked by horizontal and
		vertical position in reference to bottom bracket. These are
		to most important values to fit a bicycle to customer.
		
	Reference Tab:
		If you have an existing dimension sheet of a bicycle you
		can use these values in this tab and get the base geometry
		for rattleCAD. After capture these values you can copy them
        to personal via "Reference Geometry" Button in the button bar. 		
   

  
How to print
-----------------------------------------------------------------

    rattleCAD uses postscript does not directly send the content
    to a printer and uses a postscript viewer to print from there. 
    You have to install a postsript viewer like
        gsview:  http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/gsview/index.htm
    
    gsview is not part of rattleCAD
    
    You can also use any other programs to view .ps-files and print 
    the content there.
